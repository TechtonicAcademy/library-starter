# Library Phase 1 Starter Template

This is an practice example of what the Library project for the Magnitude cohort might look like once you stand it up initially.

The root of the repo contains the frontend application (/ui); this example doesn't include anything from the backend. During frontend development, the REST API will be simulated using a local db.json file hosted with json-server.

To install the repo, first clone it, then cd into the /ui directory and run npm install. Use npm start to run the application on port 1234. (If this does not work, please let us know.)
