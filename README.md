# Library Phase 1 Starter Template

This is an example of what students from the August accelerated cohort will build during the Library Setup lesson and use as the basis for the first phase of their Library project. This configuration implements TypeScript and SCSS with a Parcel bundler.

The root of the repo contains the frontend application (/ui). Students will build the Node/Express application once frontend functionality is achieved. Until then, the REST API will be simulated using a local db.json file hosted with json-server.

To install the repo, first clone it, then cd into the /ui directory and run npm install. Use npm start to run the application on port 1234. (If this does not work, please let us know.)
